# AuthAndAuthorization

## Overview

This project is a Next.js-based application where users can log in or sign up using **GitHub** or **Google** as OAuth providers, integrated with **Auth.js** for authentication. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to implement authentication using popular third-party providers in a modern web application.

## Features

- **OAuth Authentication**: Users can sign in using **GitHub** or **Google** accounts.
- **Session Management**: The application manages user sessions, allowing users to stay logged in across pages.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface adapts to both light and dark color schemes.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building modern, full-stack web applications.
- **Auth.js**: A library for handling authentication and managing user sessions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive and customizable UIs.
- **GitHub OAuth**: Allows users to log in via their GitHub account.
- **Google OAuth**: Allows users to log in via their Google account.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usama7871/nextauthassignment.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd nextauthassignment
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

In the root of the project, create a `.env.local` file and add your OAuth credentials for **GitHub** and **Google**.

```plaintext
# .env.local
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_github_client_id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>
```

You can generate these credentials from the respective OAuth provider's developer platform.

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Login / Signup**: On the homepage, you can either log in or sign up by clicking on the **Sign in with GitHub** or **Sign in with Google** buttons.
2. **Logout**: Once signed in, a button will appear to **Sign out** of your account.


## Future Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for OAuth failures or network issues.
- **User Profile**: Add a user profile page where users can view and edit their account details.
- **Persistent Authentication**: Ensure session persistence across page reloads.
- **Styling**: Enhance the UI for a more polished and user-friendly experience.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how to implement authentication in a Next.js application using **GitHub** and **Google** OAuth providers, integrated with **Auth.js** for session management. It demonstrates modern authentication techniques and provides a secure, user-friendly login system.

### Additional Notes for Submission:
Make sure you replace the placeholder OAuth credentials in `.env.local` with your actual credentials for both GitHub and Google. 

If you deploy this project, ensure that the `.env.local` file is excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.
